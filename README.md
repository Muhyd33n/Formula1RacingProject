# Cloud Data Platform: Formula 1 Race Data Analysis with Azure Databricks

This project showcases my journey through learning Azure Databricks, Azure services, Data Architecture, and Data Engineering Lifecycle 

## Project Overview
In this project, I'm learning Data engineering Lifecycle which Data generation, Storage, Ingestion, Transformation and Serving. Here are the main components and steps I've undertaken:

Data Ingestion: I've integrated an External API, specifically the ErgastAPI, to pull Formula 1 race data. This data is ingested into Azure Data Lake Storage using Azure Data Factory pipelines.

Data Transformation: Raw race data is transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. I've employed data cleansing techniques and performed enrichment to enhance its quality.

Presentation Layer: The transformed data is organized in a way that simplifies access and analysis, providing a solid foundation for insights generation.

Interactive Dashboards: I  created interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI, allowing users to intuitively explore the analyzed data.

Data Lakehouse Architecture with Delta Lake: I will be  exploring the emerging data lakehouse architecture and implementing it using Delta Lake.

Security: Recognizing the importance of data security, I've implemented access controls and security measures to ensure data integrity and compliance.

## Technologies and Tools
This project enables me to gain production knowledge in a variety of technologies and tools, including:

Microsoft Azure Portal: For managing cloud resources and services.

ErgastAPI: The source of Formula 1 race data.

Azure Data Factory: For orchestrating data pipelines and automating data ingestion.

Azure Databricks: Empowering advanced processing and transformation.

Power BI: Enabling the creation of insightful visualizations and dashboards
